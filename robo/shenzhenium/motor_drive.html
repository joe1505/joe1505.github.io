<h1>Motor Drivers</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>DC motors typically use an H-bridge drive circuit. This allows
forward and backward operation by reversing the polarity of the voltage
applied to the motor.
<p>For the small motors in small robots, there are two basic ways to implement an H-bridge
circuit:
<ul>
<li>Bipolar transistors
<li>Field effect (MOS) transistors
</ul>
<p> When used as switches these two types have significantly different electrical
characteristics.
<p>In the on state, a bipolar transistor switch operates in what's called &ldquo;saturation mode&rdquo;.
When in saturation, there is a  relatively fixed voltage drop across the transistor. I
say &ldquo;relatively&rdquo;, because it does vary somewhat with current. The saturation voltage can
be a few tenths of a volt, up to one volt or more for power transistors handling large currents.
<p> MOS transistor switches behave much like a resistor - the voltage across the transistor is
proportional to the current it's carrying. The effective resistance value depends on both the
physical size of the transistor and the applied gate voltage.
<p>So the bottom line is that a MOS-based H-bridge typically has less voltage drop across
the switch itself than a comparable bipolar implementation. That means less heating of the
switch, and less need for a heat sink. Also, for low battery voltages (say, 5 volts and below)
the difference in voltage applied to the motor itself can make a difference in performance.
<h2>Selection</h2>
<p>These are some chips commonly used in small motor driver boards.
<table>
<tr><th>Chip</th><th>Input</th><th>Output</th><th>Voltage<br>Drop</th></tr>
<tr><td>L9110</td><td>2.5-12V</td><td>800mA</td><td>2.85V@750mA,9V</td></tr>
<tr><td>HG7881</td><td>2.4-10V</td><td>0.6-1A</td><td>1.7V@800mA,6V</td></tr>
<tr><td>L298</td><td>&leq;46</td><td>2.0A</td><td>2.55V@1A<br>3.7@2A</td></tr>
<tr><td>TB6612</td><td>2.5-13.5</td><td>1.0A</td><td>0.5V@1A<br>0.15V@0.3A</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Some comments:
<ul>
<li>Values in the table are typical or recommended values from the data sheets. See the data
sheets for specifics and limitations.
<li>The L9110 and HG7881 seem very similar. Differences in the table above may be differences
in test conditions rather the differences in the chips themselves.
<li>The L298 can handle higher voltages and currents, but the high voltage drops mean it
needs a good heat sink.
<li>The TB6612 is the only MOSfet-based unit in the list, and that's clearly visible in
the voltage drops. When turned on, the chip basically looks like a 0.5 ohm resistor in
series with the motor. 
</ul>
<p> So as a selection guide:
<ul>
<li>The L9110/HG7881's are the way to go for absolute lowest cost, typically well under $1.
<li>The TB6612 is a bit more expensive, typically $1-2. The better numbers are probably worth
it in many cases.
<li>The L298 is an ok choice for higher currents and higher supply voltages, but I would consider
some of the boards using a driver chip with external discrete MOSfet's instead.
</ul>
