<h1>Inertial Measurement Units</h1>
<p> A bunch of vendors sell boards with the InvenSense IMU chips.
<ul>
<li>The IMU6000 is the baseline 6-axis chip: X, Y, and Z accelerometers, and gyroscopes
for rotation about the X, Y, and Z axes.
<li>The IMU6050 is almost the same, but has only an I2C interface. No SPI.
<li>The IMU6500 is virtually identical to the IMU6000, except it has slightly better
specifications (lower internal noise). So it should be a drop-in replacement for
the IMU6000, with improved accuracy.
<li> The IMU9250 is a 9-axis unit; it adds a 3-axis magnetometer to measure compass
heading. Per the data sheet, this unit is actually an IMU6500 with a magnetometer
chip squeezed into the same package.
</ul>
<p>So the best choice for most folks is probably the IMU6500. For 9 axes, a separate
magnetometer chip would allow better placement to avoid interference.
