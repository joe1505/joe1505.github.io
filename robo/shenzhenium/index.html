<h1>Notes on parts and PCB's from China</h1>
<p>A lot of components and assemblies from China are available on
ebay, banggood, and other sites at very low cost. However, documentation
and usage instructions are often unavailable or limited in
quality (at least in English).
<p> Here, I'm documenting my experiences with some things in the
hope it will be useful for others.
<p>First, a caution: we're talking very low cost units here (a few
dollars or less), so quality and reliability are often not the
greatest. So we're aiming at experimenters and hobbyists here, where
malfunctions and failures are not a serious problem. If reliability and
safety are issues for you, you're on the wrong page here.
<p>Also, there are <em>many</em> vendors and designs, so things that look
similar may not be exactly the same. What I'm discussing here are the
specific ones I've looked at in some detail. YMMV.
