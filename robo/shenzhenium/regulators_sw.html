<h1>Switching Regulator Boards</h1>
<p> Switching regulators can be grouped into a few basic flavors:
<dl class="min">
<dt>Buck<dd> or down: Output voltage is lower than the input voltage.
<dt>Boost<dd> or up:  Output voltage is higher than the input voltage.
<dt>Buck-Boost<dd> or up-down: Output voltage may be either higher or lower than the input voltage.
<dt>Inverting<dd> Output voltage in negative, input voltage is positive.
</dl>
<p> Typically buck-boost converters are more complicated than straight buck or boost. They
come in handy with batteries, where the voltage can vary widely depending on the state of charge.
<p> For low power applications such as an Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or similar boards, suitable
Chinese regulators typically consist of a single-chip switching regulator with the
inductors and capacitors it requires. So comparing boards means finding the data sheet for
the IC.
<h2>Selection Considerations</h2>
<p> First step in selecting a regulator is to make sure it can deliver
the output voltage and current needed, and that it
can handle the input voltage.
<p> Other significant parameters to consider are:
<dl class="min">
<dt>Switch frequency<dd>a higher switching frequency means lower
    inductor and capacitor values can be used. In other words, higher
    frequency means the circuit can be smaller and cheaper.
<dt>Synchronous<dd>the function of the diode is performed instead
    by circuitry inside the chip. In addition to saving one component,
    efficiency is usually higher.
<dt>Switch type<dd>Chips using bipolar transistors are usually cheaper,
    but FET's tend to be more efficient.
</dl>
<h2>My Buys</h2>

<p>For the third one, the Ebay listing said the board uses the MP1484 chip, but the ones I received
are marked MP2307. Assuming the chip markings are accurate and not counterfits, it's a
slightly better chip than what I ordered.
<br clear=all>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>For a simple test, I connected the LM2596 and MP2307 to a 12-volt supply (measured 12.13 actual)
with a resistor load measured at 63.0 ohms. Output voltage was set to approximately 5 Volts
using the on-board potentiometers.

<p>The data sheets for the two chips assume operation at higher currents (1 to 2 Amperes). The LM2596
output waveform is consistent with discontinuout mode (ie, lightly loaded), and the measured
efficiencies are roughly consistent with the published curves (efficiencies should be in the
90 to 95% range at 1A output).
<p> I didn't do measurements on the XL6009: I only have one, and I managed to damage it. Per a
  <a href="https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/308143/reduce-current-flowing-into-a-switch-by-using-xl6009-enable-pin">Discussion on Stack Exchange</a>,
this board appears to use a two-inductor circuit for up-down operation. That's said to be simpler,
cheaper, and less efficient than the transformer-based circuit recommended in the data sheet.

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>For small (eg, tabletop) robots, the MP2307 board looks good. It has higher efficiency
   and lower output ripple.
<p>For my own use, I like the LM2596 if the input power source is noisy - such as when there are
big DC motors powered by the same battery. The high maximum input voltage leaves room for some
voltage spikes, etc.
<p>Buck-boost converters are handy when you need them, but buck-only is a better choice where
possible.
